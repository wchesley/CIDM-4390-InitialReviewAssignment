# CIDM 4390 Initial Review Assignments 1 & 2
First two initial review assignments for Fall 2020 4390 are as follows: 


# Assignment One - Coding Club Membership Design  
These design documents are located in the docs folder of the repo

## Description

In CIDM4360 you developed one of your key foundations for your Computer Information Systems training and for your success in CIDM4390: systems design and specification.  In CIDM4360, you were exposed to a set of design specification and modeling techniques, templates, and documents derived from the Unified Modeling Language.  The UML models, specification documents, and other design models given to you in that class are all tools for designing systems to be built and maintained.  What is critical for CIDM4390 is that you are able to wield these tools effectively.  The purpose of this assignment is to assess your mastery of the Systems Analysis and Design (CIDM4360) material, as well as Database (CIDM3350) design material, and your ability to apply this mastery to a new context.  Additionally, in CIDM3350, you were tasked with defining a reciprocal tool related to the Domain Object Model: the Entity-Relationship Diagram.  You are being asked to include an ERD into the mix of design artifacts you submit for this assignment.
Reviewing the Tools

The methods and tools you learned in CIDM4360 are as follows:

- Descriptions of primary and secondary actors
- Use Cases
- Class Diagrams 
- Sequence Diagrams
- Activity Diagrams

Additionally, you used Visio in CIDM3350 to create an Entity-Relationship-Diagram.  Thus, you are also expected to create:

- An ERD
- SQL DDL statement to create your tables and constraints (keys, indicies, etc.)

## Case Design Context

For this exercise, I would like for you plan for a system that tracks student membership and activities in a student organization called "The Coding Club." The simplest expression of activities is that members join the club, organize into teams, are assigned to projects, which, in turn, are associated with a client.  In any case to learn more about this problem, plan to do research, consult with subject matter experts (SMEs) and  develop an initial system design for managing a the process of accepting new members and the management of teams, projects, and clients. Your design should include all of the artifacts and outputs reviewed above.  Depending on the quality of your research, you will either have to satisfice (satisfy and suffice) with what you can glean from asking around.  For instance, the CIDM department has a "coding club" called the Buffteks, ask student members of that organization how things might work. Additionally, you can ask me as well.
## Purpose and Intent

The purpose of this assignment is to measure your achievement in CIDM3350 and CIDM4360.  As a baseline measure, it is important that you DO THIS WORK ON YOUR OWN.  This is NOT A GROUP PROJECT.  However, I am not expecting a document that is the equivalent of what you turned in for your final projects in either CIDM3350 or CIDM4360.  All that is needed is the set of design artifacts (the models, diagrams, etc) all placed into a single Microsoft Word document.  I would expect that you will use the same tools from your previous coursework.  While this is a graded assignment, it is, again, mostly a means I am utilizing to baseline your retention and mastery of the old material.
Details (Right and Wrong)

You will no doubt develop MANY questions related to what actors you should model in the system, what the extent of the system should be, etc.  Given my purposes, aim, and intent for the work, I am NOT the person you should consult.  Rather, ask your old professors, re-read your textbooks, and ask around.  Treat this like a skills/technical test for a job - you can't ask the person giving you the test much - just take the test.

This is quite a bit of work, but the purpose isn't for it to be a tidy report, just a rendering of the design tools, for software and data, which reflect your knowledge in CIDM3350 and CIDM4360.  We will test your knowledge of CIDM2315 and CIDM3312 shortly after this assignment.
Submitting your Work

As indicated above, I would like for you to place all of these diagrams into a single Microsoft Word document and then include that document, and the following items, into a compressed folder archive (ZIP file) and submit that ZIP file as an attachment to this dropbox.

Items to include:

- Any original Draw.IO exports (PDF) and/or Visual Studio Code project/source files
- Your final Microsoft Word document containing all of the above diagrams
- Any other supporting materials


# Assignment Two - Coding Club Membership Prototype

## Description

This assignment is meant for you to exercise the skills you've developed in CIDM2315 and CIDM3312 such that you implement a quick prototype of the Coding Club Membership project (from assignment one) with at least two ASP.NET MVC Core 2.0 views/forms which perform CRUD operations on the underlying schema and model.  This is by no means meant to be a complete application, rather, this is meant to demonstrate to me that you have the basic skills to be productive.  I am providing you with some guidelines/constraints for the project:
Requirements

- Create at least two ASP.NET MVC Core 3.1 (using Razor pages or MVC) form/views that utilize a local SQLite database (DB file)
- Each form should facilitate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your underlying model
- Each form should be from a different actor's perspective

## Deliverable

- Must ZIP up code
- Must include Pair Retrospective and Review report
